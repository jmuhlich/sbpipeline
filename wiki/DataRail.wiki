A novel aspect of DataRail  is its focus on data integrity through the use of a flexible metadata structure. As data is processed in the toolbox, DataRail keeps track of data origins and creates an internal copy of functions and parameters that are used. Thus, a DataRail Project is self-contained and can serve as a way to exchange both data and models.

The toolbox comprises the data-handling component of a larger effort in the 
[http://www.cdpcenter.org/ Cell Decision Processes Center] at MIT and Harvard Medical School to create Systems Biology pipeline software (SBPipeline) for managing data, protocols, assumptions, and models.

DataRail was developed by members of the Sorger Lab, Harvard Medical School Department of Systems Biology and of the Lauffenburger Lab, MIT Biological Engineering. The primary developers of DataRail are [http://saezrodriguez.googlepages.com Julio Saez-Rodriguez] and Arthur Goldsipe; Jeremy Muhlich and Bjorn Millard also assist in the development of DataRail and are developing additional components of SBPipeline.

Data can be exported in a minimal information standard (MIDAS-Minimal Information for Data Analysis in Systems Biology) as well as in specific formats for
