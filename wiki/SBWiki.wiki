#summary is a wiki-based system which utilizes Semantic Web technologies and a lightweight data entry and cataloging framework to support collaborative management of unstructured and semi-structured Systems Biology data.

SB-Wiki aims to capture high-level knowledge of models, specifically the set of assumptions necessary for model interpretation that heretofore have not been encoded in any concrete manner (particularly pre-publication), along with lower-level SBML-compliant RDF annotations. SB-Wiki also tracks the experimental data used to train or evaluate models, such as details of the biological setting (species, cell type, growth or culture conditions) and experimental protocol; SB-Wiki integrates well with DataRail on this point, but both tools also support independent use.
